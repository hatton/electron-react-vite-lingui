  // If we are run from outside of a packaged app, our working directory is the right place to be.

  // appPath varies by platform and scenario:

  // windows from source: <somewhere>"\myapp\node_modules\electron\dist\resources\default_app.asar"
  // mac from source: <somewhere>"/myapp/node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/default_app.asar"

  //  windows from installed package: assets & sample data are one level up from apppath:
  //                        "C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Programs\myapp\resources\app.asar"
  // mac from a package: <somewhere>"/my.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar"
  // windows from (uninstalled) package: assets & sample data are one level up from apppath:
  //                       <somewhere>"\myapp\release\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar"

  // In most cases, our extra files (assets/, sample data/) are all on the file system, and
  // the working directory is set such that they are the immediate children.

  // However when running from a packaged up mac app, the whole file tree has been encased in a single file,
  // and the working directory is who-knows-where; it cannot point into that archive.
  // However electron manages to intercept filesytem calls so you can point into the insides of the app.
  // In this case, apppPath will be <somewhere>/my.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar
  // But the root we want, to be the same as the other situations, is in my.app/contents.
